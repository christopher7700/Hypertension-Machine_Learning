Implemented Machine Learning algorithm to predict if patients have high blood pressure.

Dataset has insight into adult overall health data and was gathered from Kaggle/datasets.com.

Coded in Python and used NumPy, Pandas, and XGBoost libraries to transform data and implement the model.

Successfully create a model with 73% Accuracy in predicting if adults have high blood pressure.

The study concludes: Adults that who participate in physical activity and have a healthy diet are less likely to have hypertension.
